      <h1>Reduction Of Sanction</h1>
      <p>
        A sanction may be reduced in a number of ways, depending on the nature
        of the ADRV, the timing of any admission to the charge and/or the
        nature of the Prohibited Substance(s) detected in an Athlete's sample.
        Reductions can be applied due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Voluntarily admitting the ADRV in the absence of other evidence.</li>
        <li>
          Reaching a case resolution agreement with NADA India and WADA and
          applying a reduction after assessing the individual's degree of
          Fault, the seriousness of the ADRV and how promptly the violation was
          admitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          An Athlete establishing that their use of a non-Specified Substance
          was not "intentional" (as that term is defined in the rules). This
          will also usually require the Athlete to establish how the Prohibited
          Substance entered their system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Establishing "No Fault or Negligence", or alternatively "No
          Significant Fault or Negligence". A ban may be eliminated entirely as
          a result of No Fault or Negligence when an individual can establish
          that they did not know or suspect, or could not have reasonably known
          or suspected, even with the utmost caution that they had violated an
          anti-doping rule. No Fault or Negligence is applied in very rare
          circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          The application of No Significant Fault or Negligence occurs where
          the individual establishes that any Fault or negligence, when viewed
          in the totality of the circumstances, was not significant. Reductions
          for No Significant Fault or Negligence may also be applied in cases
          involving Specified Substances or Specified Methods, Contaminated
          Products or Athletes who are classed as "Protected Persons" or
          "Recreational Athletes".
        </li>
        <li>
          Reaching a Results Management Agreement in a situation, where an
          Athlete is facing a ban of four or more years, if they accept the
          ADRV(s) and applicable consequences within 20 days from the date of
          the receipt of Notice of Charge, then he/she will be entitled for
          reduction of one year ineligibility period.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ADRV involving a "Substance of Abuse". An Athlete may receive a
          reduced sanction of three months if an Athlete is comfortable.
        </li>
      </ul>
