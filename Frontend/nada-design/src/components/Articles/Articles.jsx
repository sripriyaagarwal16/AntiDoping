          Through doping, we understand the use by athletes of substances prohibited by the antidoping agencies in order to gain a competitive advantage. Since sport plays an important role in physical and mental education and in promoting international understanding and cooperation, the widespread use of doping products and methods has consequences not only on health of the athletes, but also upon the image of sport. Thus, doping in sports is forbidden for both ethical and medical reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
          Narcotics and analgesics, anabolic steroids, hormones, selective androgen receptor modulators are among the most frequently utilized substances.
          Although antidoping controls are becoming more rigorous, doping and, very importantly, masking doping methods are also advancing, and these are usually one step ahead of doping detection techniques.

          Depending on the sport practiced and the physical attributes it requires, the athletes will look for one or more of the following benefits of doping: recovering from an injury, increasing body recovery capacity after training, increasing muscle mass and strength, decreasing fat tissue, increasing endurance.

          Doping has become a key and complex issue in the sports world, which deserves serious consideration, as specialists are still striving to understand how and why it happens, and how to prevent it. "Sensational" revelations in the press reflect the gravity of a worrying situation resonating in most sports disciplines.
          </p>
          <p>
          Cases of doping compromise the credibility of performance in sport, the mediatized victories of some "arena heroes" becoming questionable and disputable. Nowadays some sporting disciplines seem to have managed to surpass the human limits and sometimes even the legal limits. The financial interests, the pressure to obtain better results, the media coverage of sports competitions and, last but not least, the human nature can explain this phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p>
          It is clear that in some disciplines such as athletics or cycling, human performance cannot improve endlessly. Nowadays, sports are no longer just sports; as sport become an industry, a business, a reason for political or national pride, and these facts can only lead to breaking any rules to win. Sometimes, consciously, camouflaged, with a network of specialists behind or on their own, some athletes think "maybe they wonâ€™t catch me"; because today sports mean sponsors, advertising contracts and money and for that some believe that any risk is worth taking. Even risks to their own health (often with huge and irreversible consequences) no longer matter.

          Over time, there have been several definitions of doping. Beckmann's sports dictionary describes doping as the use of performance-increasing substances, which would place the athlete on a superior position than that he would normally have obtained.</p>

          How does an athlete win a lot of money? From an important race and from sponsors. Where do organizers of sporting events have substantial prize money? From sponsors. Why do sponsors give substantial amounts of prizes? For publicity and to be associated with a first class sporting event where the best athletes participate. Who is watching a first class sports event? Everyone. The same people that will no longer watch the event when the athletes no longer offer the necessary show. The athletes today can be associated to the gladiators from Ancient Rome who were providing The commercial side of a sporting event is also an important matter. If people like the event in the modern arena, then the commercial success of the sporting event is assured and the sponsors are satisfied and will finance future events, thus providing funds for the organizers to give substantial prizes for the athletes.

          The doping phenomenon in sports is increasing and diversifying, as are the drugs used for doping. There is a permanent race among those who invent new doping methods and sports ethics organizations that are searching for more performant methods to detect them. Unfortunately, most of the times, those in the first category are always one step ahead.
